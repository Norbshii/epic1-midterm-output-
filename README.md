## **_Cyber Virus_**

Because viruses are omnipresent, whether in our environment as well as on our computers, I chose this design. This design was also influenced by a tiktok video I came upon while scrolling; in the video, the student is required to sketch a virus, but he does so using Python. I performed some research and began coding in this approach. The source for this art was just a tiktok video that I saw few months ago.

## **_Programmed Rasengan_**

I chose this design because I was intrigued, I'm a Naruto fan, and something came to me. I was going to sketch a sharingan, but I think it's overrated after seeing a lot of source codes on the internet. I also looked for a rasengan but couldn't find one as I scrolled, so I decided to make one.Â I made this design using a bunch of circles and a few lines to simulate a rasengan's spiral effect. My source for this art was just a hd picture of a rasengan from google.

## **_Rickness Portal_**

I chose this design because I enjoy the Rick and Morty cartoon, therefore I looked up how to generate a spiral effect with lines on YouTube, because the spiral effect is similar to the effects shown in Rick and Morty when they use their portal gun. Because it was merely a handful of lines combined and put into a pattern, this code didn't have many lines. The source for this art was a youtube video showing how to make a spiral using lines.
