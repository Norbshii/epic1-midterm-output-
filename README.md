**I am _RIRI/Norbshii_/Norberto Pingoy** and these are my Mandala Projects in Python Graphics
## **_Cyber Virus_**

I chose this design because viruses are everywhere, in our environment or even in our computers. This design is also inspired in a tiktok video that I saw while I was scrolling, in the video, the student is asked to draw a virus but he used python to create the drawing. I did some research and got into this type of coding. The source for this art was just a tiktok video that I saw few months ago.

## **_Programmed Rasengan_**

I chose this design out of curiousity, I am a Naruto fan, and something came up in my mind. I was gonna draw a sharingan but I find it overrated because I saw many source codes accorss the internet. I also searched for a rasengan but nothing came up as I scroll, so I did this drawing using bunch of circles and few lines to make the spiral like effect of a rasengan. My source for this art was just an hd picture of a rasengan from google.

## **_Rickness Portal_**

I chose this design because I am also a fan of the rick and morty cartoon, so I tried to search in youtube on how to make a spiral like effect using lines, because the spiral like effect is like the effects in rick and morty when they use their portal gun. This Code didn't have much line on it because It just a bunch of lines connected and made into a pattern. The source for this art was a youtube video showing how to make a spiral using lines.
